    // `Hailey writes: I've had a life long battle with depression and anxiety, and for as long as I can remember, I was never happy. One day, things got really bad. I ran away from home, attempted to kill myself (unsuccessfully, obviously), and the next day, I woke up and realized that I didn't really want to die.  I made the best decision I've ever made by admitting myself into an institution. I was wary about it at first, because I'd been there before, but I thought it might be different, since it was my choice this time. The one thing that kept me holding on was a statement that my best friend made. She said that no matter how hard things got, no matter how hopeless I felt, things would always be okay in the end. I didn't believe it, oh, not at all, but I hoped that maybe, just maybe, she was right. I spent a week in that hospital, and it wasn't fun in the least bit, but it was without a doubt the best experience of my life. I learned so much about myself, and I got to be around people who were going through the same things as me. One day I told my doctor a big secret, something I'd never shared with anybody, and after sharing that with him, and eventually with my parents, I knew I was ready. I realized that that was the biggest thing holding me back, and letting it out made me feel so much better. I went home, and I saw the world with a whole new perspective. I appreciated the small things, the seemingly insignificant. I was happy to be alive, and excited for what each new day had to bring. I had finally taken care of myself, instead of putting others first. Now, I'm the happiest I've ever been, and I'm living (and loving) my life. I've managed to go from having such a bleak outlook on the world that I really didn't care to see tomorrow, to being one of the most optimistic people I know.`
